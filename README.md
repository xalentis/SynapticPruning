# Synaptic Pruning: A Biological Inspiration for Machine Learning Regularization


### Introduction
Synaptic pruning is a key neuro-developmental process in biological brains that removes weak connections to improve neural efficiency. In artificial neural networks, standard dropout regularization randomly deactivates neurons during training but overlooks the activity-dependent nature of biological pruning. This study proposes a novel regularization method that better reflects biological pruning by gradually eliminating connections based on their contribution to model performance.

### Methods
Our proposed method extends beyond standard dropout by calculating feature importance using gradient magnitudes with respect to the loss function, while maintaining a historical record of importance values. The method incorporates adaptive thresholding that responds to model performance and entropy regularization to stabilize importance estimates. Unlike alternative methods that require separate training, pruning, and fine-tuning steps, our technique operates dynamically during model training as a direct substitute for standard dropout layers, permanently modifying the network structure based on learned importance metrics.

### Results
Experimental results across multiple neural network architectures (RNN, LSTM, and PatchTST) and time series forecasting datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our pruning method. The method consistently outperforms traditional techniques, with particularly substantial improvements observed in financial market applications. For the PatchTST architecture, our method reduced Mean Absolute Error by approximately 21.5% compared to alternative dropout approaches, with statistically significant improvements across multiple configurations.

### Conclusion
The proposed biologically-inspired pruning method offers a more principled alternative to standard dropout techniques by selectively removing unimportant connections based on their contribution to model performance. Beyond improved predictive accuracy, this method provides computational efficiency through network sparsification while maintaining model adaptability. These findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating more faithful bio-mimetic principles into deep learning regularization strategies, particularly for time series forecasting applications.
